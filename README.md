Information Visualization is a field in computer sciences that is mainly focused on how to visually map abstract data. Information Visualization are visual representations of the semantics, or meaning, of information. In contrast to scientific visualization, which deals with physically-based data, information visualization typically deals with nonnumeric, nonspatial, and high-dimensional data.

In many application domains, data involves a large number of attributes and categories. In industrial manufacturing, for example, numerous quality indicators are measured for each produced item along with process information such as the order ID, the used machinery, and much more. For such complex data, manually searching for visualizations that reveal interesting patterns such as correlations, trends, and outliers may become very tedious and time-consuming.

The goal of this research is to extend well known views such as scatterplots, histograms, or categorical views by integrating recommendations on demand of view parameterizations which may be worth looking at. Typical examples could include “list all scatterplots showing correlations between data attributes for any data subset”, or “rank all time-series plots by the amount of showing a clear trend over the past weeks”.

In order to experiment on Task-Oriented Guidance for Information Visualization Recommendation. We will use complex datasets from different fields to experiment in different use-cases. The datasets used are the following :

Zenodo.https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6483002

The datasets will be used to produce an interactive visualization React app using JavaScript, React and the D3 library. A recommendation system for such visualizations will also be built using the same technologies. The scripts will be hosted on a this GitHub repository.

The development of this app as well as the process behind it, are the basis of a research paper that will also be hosted in the GitHub repository as well as in the TU Wien Research Data base once it is published.
